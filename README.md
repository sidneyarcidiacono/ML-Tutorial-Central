### Getting Started

As I was breaking into Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering, I found that there are so many places to find information: Medium & other blogging sites, bootcamps, conferences, online videos, academic papers, online tutorial sites, and more.

The problem was, I couldn't find the start-to-finish information I needed on any single one of these sources! Conferences and papers felt intimidating at first, bootcamps focused solely on Python libraries and toolsets, and online tutorial sites usually only had one or two specific things, and so on.

So I created Machine Learning *Central* - a central, open source and community focused repository of tutorials and resources for users from the freshest beginners through seasoned experts looking to brush up on the latest additions.
